# 🌈 RainbowASCII Function Project

Welcome to the **RainbowASCII Function Project**, an example I created for a video! 🎥  
I’m not entirely sure why I made it, but here it is. Hopefully, you can put it to good use!  

If you do anything interesting with it, please **@ me** or message me about it! 😊
